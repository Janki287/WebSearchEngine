# WebSearchEngine
The Web Search Engine has several features, including a Web Crawler, HTML to Text Translation, Spell Checker, Sorting and Ranking, Finding the Keywords, and Word Frequency. The system will verify the spelling to see if it is valid, and if not, it will offer the closest comparable word.
